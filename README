TelepathyGlib# is a binding for telepathy-glib.

Building & Installing TelepathyGlib#:
-------------------------------------

    The build is the traditional:

        ./configure
        make
        make install

    You may want to consider using configure's prefix option to install
    TelepathyGlib# using the same prefix as Mono.  That way all of your .NET assemblies
    get placed in the same place, and you don't need to do any extra "configuring"
    to make it so mono (and mint) can find your assemblies.  In other words,
    doing something like:

        ./configure --prefix=/the/path/that/was/used/for/mono
        make
        make install

    (Of course, replace "/the/path/that/was/used/for/mono" with whatever path
    which was used for Mono.  This might have been "/usr", "/usr/local", or
    something similar.)

    If you are compiling from git, you will need libtool and the auto* tools
    and will need to replace the configure above with bootstrap for the 2.5.x
    version or bootstrap-2.4 for the 1.9.x version.

Developers:
-----------

    For developers wishing to "get started" with Gtk#, they are encouraged
    to read the Mono Hand Book:

        http://www.go-mono.com/tutorial

    In the Mono Hand Book, Chapter 21 is on Gtk#.  (In the Mono Hand Book,
    the Gtk# .NET bindings are refered to as GNOME.NET.)
